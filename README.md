## Demo


## Scalability
Currently the application stores User and Group data on MongoDB Real-Time Database. Every smartphone with the app running needs to establish a connection to the database in order to sync data with the cloud. The app will run even without an internet connection, but in order to view the latest transactions of a group, you will need to query data from the database.
